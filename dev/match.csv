 The university was founded in 1972 and was initially intended as an alternative to the traditional Danish universities which had been the scene of several student uprisings in the late 1960s. The students considered the traditional universities undemocratic and controlled by the professors and wanted more influence as well as more flexible teaching methods.
 In the 1970s the university was known for its very liberal education as opposed to the usual lectures provided by the more traditional universities of Copenhagen and Aarhus.

 Roskilde (UK: /ˈrɒskɪlə/ ROSK-il-ə,[2]also US: /ˈrʌskiːlə/ RUSK-ee-lə,[3]Danish: [ˈʁɒskilə]), located 30 km (19 mi) west of Copenhagen on the Danish island of Zealand, is the main city in the eponymous municipality. With a population of 51,121 (as of 1 January 2019[update]),[1] the city is a business and educational centre for the region and the 10th largest city in Denmark. It is governed by the administrative council of Roskilde Municipality.
 Roskilde has a long history, dating from the pre-Christian Viking Age. Its UNESCO-listed Gothic cathedral, now housing 39 tombs of the Danish monarchs, was completed in 1275, becoming a focus of religious influence until the Reformation.
With the development of the rail network in the 19th century, Roskilde became an important hub for traffic with Copenhagen, and by the end of the century, there were tobacco factories, iron foundries and machine shops.
